                <h3>Commercial Considerations</h3>
                
                <p>The core EXTRA platform will be open source and will not be directly monetized.</p>
                
                <p>However, the EXTRA platform does create opportunities for monetization, including companies offering support services, hosting the EXTRA software as a service and integrating the EXTRA classification engine within commercial Content Management Systems.</p>
                
                <p>There is also an opportunity for the development and maintenance of the rule sets applied by the EXTRA platform, either as consulting services or as commercial offerings. In particular, there is the opportunity to create rule sets targeted at particular taxonomies and content sets, including beyond the general news domain covered by the IPTC’s Media Topics.</p>
