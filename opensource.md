## Open Source

By “open source”, we specifically mean software licensed under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

Choose a License [describes](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) the MIT License as “A short and simple permissive license with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices. Licensed works, modifications, and larger works may be distributed under different terms and without source code.”

Any existing software that is used as part of the EXTRA project would therefore need to be licensed using the MIT license (or something that can be easily demonstrated to be compatible).
